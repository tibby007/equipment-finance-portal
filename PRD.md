# Comprehensive PRD for Equipment Finance Vendor Portal

## Project Context
You are building a multi-tenant SaaS equipment finance vendor portal that streamlines broker-vendor workflows and deal management. The tech stack is:
- Frontend: NextJS with Shadcn UI components
- Backend: n8n workflow automation via webhooks
- Database & Auth: Supabase
- Payments: Stripe integration for subscriptions

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Product Overview
An equipment finance vendor portal that eliminates communication gaps and workflow inefficiencies between brokers and their vendor networks. Brokers can manage multiple vendors through tiered subscriptions, while vendors get tools to prequalify deals and submit complete applications with shared pipeline visibility.

### 2. User Personas
**Brokers**: Equipment finance professionals who process deals and manage vendor networks. Need pipeline control, vendor management, and resource sharing capabilities.

**Vendors**: Equipment suppliers/dealers who originate deals for brokers. Need prequalification tools, application forms, document upload, and pipeline visibility.

**Super Admin**: System administrator with oversight of all broker accounts and subscription management.

### 3. User Journey Map

**Broker Flow:**
1. Signs up and selects subscription tier
2. Invites vendors via email with auto-generated credentials
3. Receives new leads from vendors in kanban board
4. Moves deals through pipeline stages
5. Communicates with vendors via two-way notes in deal cards
6. Manages resource library for vendor education
7. Views metrics on dashboard

**Vendor Flow:**
1. Receives email invitation with login credentials
2. Changes default password on first login
3. Uses prequalification tool (gets red/yellow/green result)
4. Completes online application for qualified deals
5. Uploads supporting documents (invoices, quotes, misc)
6. Watches deal progress through shared kanban view
7. Communicates with broker via deal card notes
8. Views personal metrics on dashboard
